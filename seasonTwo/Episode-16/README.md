# Episode-16 | DevTinder UI - Part 2

- In the second part of the DevTinder UI series, we delve into styling and enhancing the user interface.
- Learn how to use CSS and component libraries to design a visually appealing layout.
- We’ll also refine the initial components, add interactive elements, and implement navigation between different screens.
- This episode focuses on creating a cohesive and user-friendly design that elevates the look and feel of the DevTinder application.

<!-- My notes -->

- Let's start with login, logout & signup features.
- Create a Login Page
  - To make an API call - we will use `axios` [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).
    - `pnpm add axios` - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- Bypass cors error when making call from frontend to backend.
  - let's install the `cors` [middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) or refer this [expressjs-cors](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html)
    - `pnpm add cors` in backend
    - need to whitelist the UI origin to be able to set cookies on browser otherwise the axios won't allow to store it for http requests.
- you need to do set of things to accept cookies on browser.
- whenever you're making API call with axios - u need to pass `{withCredentials:true}`

- Now we will store the data into `redux store`. The Redux store is a single, centralized object that holds the entire global state of a JavaScript application. It acts as the "single source of truth" for the application's data, providing a predictable way to manage how that state changes over time.
  - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) can be used for any application that places a high priority on the ability to store states. It should be clear that Redux can be used for the client side (frontend) with user interfaces. However, since Redux is just JavaScript, it can also be used on the server side (backend).
  - _Redux Toolkit is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications._
  - [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Add the Redux Toolkit and React-Redux packages to your project - [Usage Instructions](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) - `pnpm add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`

```md
### Key Responsibilities of the Redux Store

The store is the core of Redux and comes with a few essential methods for interacting with the application state:

- `Holds the current application state`: The global state is stored internally within the store as a single object tree.

- `getState()`: Allows components to access the current state of the application.

- `dispatch(action)`: This is the only way to trigger a state change. An action is a plain JavaScript object describing what happened in the application, and dispatching it signals an intent to update the state.

- `subscribe(listener)`: Registers a callback function that will be executed any time an action is dispatched and the state might have changed. This allows the UI to update with the new data.
```

- Create a file in `src/utils/` - `appStore.js` - This creates a Redux store, and also automatically configure the Redux DevTools extension so that you can inspect the store while developing.
- we have to provide this `Store` to the application - Go to `App.jsx` - wrap the code inside the `<Provider>ExisitingApp.jsxCode</Provider>` component from react-redux
- Now this store can consists of `Slices` - A "slice" in Redux is a term for the portion of the Redux state and its corresponding logic (reducers and actions) that relates to a single feature of your application. The name comes from the idea of splitting the single, large Redux state object into multiple, manageable "slices" of state.

```md
### Key Concepts of a Redux Slice

- `Bundles Logic`: A slice combines the initial state, the reducer logic, and the action creators for a specific feature (e.g., "users", "posts", "counter") into a single file or module.
- `createSlice` Function: This utility function simplifies the traditional Redux setup by automatically generating action type strings and action creator functions based on the names of the reducer functions you provide.
- `Immutable Updates Made Easy`: Internally, createSlice uses a library called Immer which allows you to write state updates as if you were directly mutating the state (e.g., state.value = 1), but it actually translates these into safe, immutable updates behind the scenes.
- `Modularity`: Slices promote modularity and separation of concerns by keeping all the related state management logic for a feature in one place, making the code easier to organize, read, and maintain.
- `Integration`: The reducer function generated by a slice is then exported and combined with other slice reducers to form the single "root reducer" that is passed to the Redux store.
```

- let's create `userSlice.js`
  - In that file, import the createSlice API from Redux Toolkit.
  - Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.
- Now you want to store the data(user when logged into APP) into redux store using hook - `import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux'`
- Add this [Redux DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) into chrome browser.
  - We can view the store.
- Once the user is logged in - we can update the UserProfile Icon on Navbar - by subscribing to the store. Go to NavBar.jsx & import the `useSelector() Hook` to subscribe to the store.
- Once the User logged in - Navigate the user to main page

# DevTinder Frontend - UI (part 2) Development 🚀

## 📌 Code Demonstration Links

🔗 **Backend Repository:** [DevTinder Backend](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/devTinder-backend)  
🔗 **Frontend Repository:** [DevTinder Frontend](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/devTinder-frontend)

## 📌 Overview

DevTinder is a **MERN stack** web application designed to help developers **connect and collaborate**, similar to Tinder but for the tech community.

This update focuses on **building the authentication page, integrating API calls, and implementing state management using Redux Toolkit**. The login system ensures secure authentication using **JWT tokens stored in cookies**, with proper CORS configuration to handle credentials.

---

## ✅ Steps Completed

### **1️⃣ Created Login Page**

- Designed a **responsive login page** with an input form for email and password.
- Used controlled components in React to handle form inputs.
- Added form validation to prevent empty fields or incorrect email formats.
- Styled the page using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean UI.

### **2️⃣ Installed & Configured Axios**

- Installed **Axios**, a promise-based HTTP client, to manage API requests efficiently.
- Set up **global Axios defaults** to include the backend’s base URL for easy request handling.
- Used **async-await** inside API functions to ensure proper request handling.

### **3️⃣ Installed & Configured CORS in Backend**

- Installed **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** middleware to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend.
- Configured CORS settings in the backend by specifying:
  - **origin**: Allows requests only from the frontend domain.
  - **credentials: true**: Enables sending cookies with API requests.
- Without proper CORS configuration, the browser blocks API requests due to security policies.

### **4️⃣ Making API Calls with Credentials**

- Modified all Axios requests to include `{ withCredentials: true }`.
- This ensures the backend sends **cookies containing the JWT token** to the frontend.
- If `credentials: true` is not passed, the backend will **not store or retrieve session tokens**, breaking authentication.
- Implemented proper error handling to display user-friendly messages if login fails.

### **5️⃣ Installed Redux Toolkit & React Redux**

- Installed **Redux Toolkit**, which simplifies global state management compared to traditional Redux.
- Installed **React Redux**, allowing components to connect with the Redux store.
- Redux helps manage authentication state across different components, ensuring data consistency.

### **6️⃣ Configured Redux Store**

- Wrapped the application with `<Provider>` to enable global state management.
- Created **Redux slices** to manage authentication, including:
  - **User data storage** after login.
  - **Token storage for future API requests**.
- Added the authentication slice to the **Redux store** and ensured state updates upon login.

### **7️⃣ Installed Redux DevTools for Chrome**

- Installed **Redux DevTools**, a browser extension to monitor state changes.
- Verified that login updates **Redux state correctly**, ensuring user authentication status is reflected across components.

### **8️⃣ Verified Login Flow & Redux Integration**

- Logged in with test credentials and **confirmed that user data is stored in Redux state**.
- Checked **Redux DevTools** to monitor state updates after login.
- Ensured that token persistence works properly for future API calls.

### **9️⃣ Updated Navbar After Login**

- Modified the **Navbar component** to reflect authentication status dynamically.
- Once logged in, the navbar:
  - **Displays the user’s profile picture** retrieved from Redux state.
  - **Shows a welcome message** with the logged-in user’s name.
- Ensured that these updates happen instantly after login without requiring a page refresh.

### **🔟 Code Refactoring & Organization**

- Created a **constants file** for storing the backend’s base URL.
- Moved **reusable UI components** (Navbar, Footer, etc.) to a dedicated **components folder**.
- Ensured that all API calls are **modular and reusable**, improving code maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

- **Build Signup Page**: Develop user registration with proper validation and API integration.
- **Session Persistence**: Implement logic to keep users logged in even after a page refresh.
- **Logout Functionality**: Add a **logout button** that clears the session and updates UI dynamically.
- **Feed Page Development**: Start building the **developer feed UI**, where users can explore profiles.

---

## 🔥 Conclusion

The **authentication system** is now integrated with the backend, and state management is fully set up using **Redux Toolkit**. The next focus will be on improving **user session management, signup functionality, and logout handling**.

With **Axios for API calls, Redux for state management, and CORS for secure token handling**, DevTinder’s authentication is now **structured, secure, and scalable**. 🚀
